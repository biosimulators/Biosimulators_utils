# BioSimulators utils
Command-line application and high-level utilities for reading, writing, validating, and executing [COMBINE/OMEX format](https://combinearchive.org/) files that contain descriptions of simulations in [Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language](https://sed-ml.org/) (SED-ML) format with models in formats such as the [BioNetGen Language](https://bionetgen.org) (BNGL) and the [Systems Biology Markup Language](http://sbml.org) (SBML).

## Installation

### Requirements
* Python >= 3.7
* pip

### Optional requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): required to execute containerized simulation tools
* [Java](https://www.java.com/): required to parse and validate NeuroML/LEMS files
* [Perl](https://www.perl.org/): required to parse and validate BioNetGen files
* [RBApy](https://sysbioinra.github.io/RBApy/): required to parse and validate RBA files
* [XPP](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html): required to parse and validate XPP files

## Dockerfile and Docker image

This package is available in the `ghcr.io/biosimulators/biosimulators` Docker image. This image includes all of the optional dependencies and installation options.

To install and run this image, run the following commands:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/biosimulators/biosimulators
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/biosimulators/biosimulators
```

This image includes this package, as well as standardized Python APIs for the simulation tools validated by BioSimulators. Because this image aims to incorporate as many simulation tools as possible within a single Python environment, this image may sometimes lag behind the latest version of this package.

The Dockerfile for this image is available [here](https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators/blob/dev/Dockerfile).
